Stages of implementation
1. Single machine, no failure, no leader election
    a. Message passing across multiple process
    b. Protobuf message format ?
    c. write log for each node
    d. Read all logs to generate a sequence of what happened
    e. Create a driver code such that it can read from a test case file and run it across nodes. Not clear on how we can simulte this across machines, but tbd.
2. non-leader node failure.
3. leader node failure
4. multi-machine, no failure
5. multi-machine, non-leader node failure
6. multi-machine, leader node failure
7. recovery?
